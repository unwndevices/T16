## Notes

- **Follow CLAUDE.md rules**: Always use feature branches, comprehensive testing, no shortcuts
- **Hardware safety first**: Never commit changes that could brick devices
- **User data protection**: Preserve calibration and configuration data across all updates
- **Performance critical**: MIDI timing must remain within real-time constraints
- **Maintain compatibility**: Existing T16 devices must continue working throughout transition
